                <h2>Ancient Scroll Found Predicts The Rise Of TikTok </h2>  <!-- Article 1-->
                <p>Archaeologist in Greece have discoverd an acient scroll that seems to predict the rise of modern social media. The parchment describes a “magical window” where people share “dances, jets, and fleeting moments” for the world to see.

The movement has sparked rumors of secret portals in thrift stores, but most participants say it’s just their way of "living analog" in a digital age.</p>
